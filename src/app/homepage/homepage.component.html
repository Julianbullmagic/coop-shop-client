<p>In 2020, an hour of human labour in Australia created about $83 of value on average, the median wage was $36/h and the average
was $28. Where did the extra value go? Cooperatives are democratic businesses owned and run by the people who use and/or work
for the business. They are the shareholders and decide what happens with the profits.</p>
