  <h2>What is a cooperative?</h2>
  <p>A cooperative (or co-op) is a democratic business owned and run by the people who work for the business.
    They are the shareholders, they elect their own managers and directors, in other words, they can hire and fire their
    own bosses. They also decide what to do with any surplus value or profits, how much to reinvest and how much to pay to
    themselves. In some cases, they don't even elect leaders and all decisions are made with direct democracy, all members
    can be involved in making all decisions. This is usually only practical in smaller co-ops with less than 50 members</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>The benefits of democratic business</h2>
    <p>There are numerous benefits to workplace democracy. Worker cooperatives tend to have a longer lifespan than capitalist
      businesses.

        In medium to large sized co-ops the workers are usually better paid than workers for capitalist firms. Their jobs
        are usually much more secure, a cooperative is much less likely to fire workers. Democratic businesses are usually more
        productive, efficient and give better value for money. The ratio between the highest and lowest
        rates of pay tends to be much lower, around 4:1 on average. The members work with much more enthusiasm because they work for
        themselves and are not being exploited by shareholder or bossed around and bullied by corporate executives.

        <h2>Why the labour theory of value is important</h2>
        <p>
          Of course, cooperation and democratic decision making can lead to smarter, better informed group choices but if we want
          a genuinely fair economy with as little exploitation as possible it should
          be accompanied by an understanding and implemenentation of the labour theory of value first popularised by the classical
          economists David Ricardo and Adam Smith. The basic idea is that the value of all goods and services is roughly proportional
          to the human labour time invested in creating them, with some variation depending on the supply and demand. All the accounts
          gathered by the statistics bureaus of all developed countries show a very strong correlation between value created and human
          labour time, roughly 95%. When we take goods off the shelf, it is usually very difficult/impossible to know exactly how
          much labour time has gone into creating them because this information is not shared between the companies involved or the shop
          that sells the product. However, government statistics bureaus do gather and publish data about the total number of hours
          worked in each industry and the total value created in each industry. This can be plotted on a graph, and there is almost
          universally a very strong correlation.
          <button class="refbutton">Reference

          </button>
          We can also calculate the average amount of value created
          per hour of human labour simply by adding all the value created in all industries then dividing it by the sum of all hours worked
          in all industries. In Australia in 2020, the average value created per hour of labour was $83 AUD, the average wage was
          only $59. The median hourly rate of pay was only $36. Even without factoring in the obscenely high cost of living,
          Australians already have between 71 and 43% of the value they create for society stolen from them by shareholders.
          More than 90% of people would benefit financially from a socialist economic system grounded in the labour theory of value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paul Cockshott, a scottish Computer Scientist with a BA in Economics and PHD in computer science does a very good job
          of explaining this theory.
        </p>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-arn--Gtu-E"></iframe>
        <p>
          Because human labour time is the source of economic value, incomes that do not come from someone's own labour are exploitative.
          That value is not appearing out of nowhere, it is being stolen from someone else. Incomes from rents, dividends, interest and
          royalties are usually forms of exploitation. If we banned individuals or private companies from doing these things, the
          vast majority of the population would be
          substantially better off financially. Sometimes landlords provide some management and maintenance services, but
          the cost of this is usually massively inflated and much higher than it should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Paul Cockshott does a very nice job of explaining these ideas.

        <p>
          In a socialist society there would still be a labour market and therefore people would be paid varying amounts.
          Jobs that are perhaps more difficult or less desireable would be require higher rates of pay to incentivise people
          to do them and less desireable jobs would be paid less. This is similar to a labour market in a capitalist society,
          however, we would eliminate forms of exploitation, passive incomes that do not come from doing any work and incomes
          that are massively inflated because of artificial/manufactured scarcity.
          </p>

        <h2>Manufactured Scarcity</h2>
        <p>
          Our technology has been advanced enough to eliminate poverty within industrialised societies since the late 19th century.
          In 1892 the russian communist Peter Kropotkin estimated that it was only necessary for one man to work 30 hours a week,
          5 hours a day for 6 days a week, in order to meet the needs of a family of 5. Of course, our technology and productive forces
          have improved very dramatically since then and the minimum amount of work time required to meet people's needs should
          have fallen very substantially.

          If all this is true, why do we still need to waste years or decades of our lives for rents,  mortgages or food? Why
          do capitalist countries still have huge numbers of homeless people? Why do 5000 children die every day from diseases
          we could easily prevent with vaccines that already exist? Why do hundreds of millions of people still experience famines?

          According to the World Health Organization, 10.4 million children died in 2004 from largely preventable causes like malnutrition and infections.(18) At least two million child deaths a year could be prevented by existing vaccines and most of the rest could be prevented by access to clean
          water, sanitation, and other basic necessities. Nearly 1.3 billion people live in absolute poverty,
          and more than 15 million adults aged 20 to 64 die every year from preventable causes.

          There is a tendency within a capitalist society for the costs of things people need to become massively inflated.
          Capitalists will hoard these goods and services, then extort prices from people that are much larger than necessary.
          The anarchy of the free-market is one of the main problems socialists have resolved with democratic central planning
          of the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is essentially why the cost of childcare and housing in Australia have risen so dramatically in recent decades.
          Houses are no more difficult to produce than they used to be, but their price has risen by more than a factor of
          five since the 1980s. These is purely because we need houses, people cannot function in a modern society while living
          on the street. It is also the reason the cost of childcare has tripled in the last three decades. In the USA,
          per capita expenditure on medicine has risen by more than a factor of ten since 1950.

          In the 2016 census, there would roughly 116000 homeless people in Australia and more than a million vacant homes.
          There is by far more than enough homes for everyone and everyone needs a home in order to be a functional member
          of society, but the supply is restricted. People will pay higher rents and mortgages if they are worried about being
          homeless. The land lord tells their tennants to pay them hundreds of dollar every week or tough luck, try sleeping out in
          cold, wind and rain where you are likely to be attacked in the middle of the night at some point or pissed on by drunk
          youths.

        <p>
          The most effective solution to this problem is public monopolies on things people need, or at least overwhelmingly dominant public
          enterprises that provide the things people need. This is why medicine is so vastly cheaper in Australia than the USA,
          we have a strong public healthcare system.
          It is also the reason why housing is vastly cheaper in socialist countries, publicly owned banks have a monopoly on
          providing home loans, allowing them to set prices much more fairly and accurately.
          Socialist countries like Cuba, Vietnam and China all have very strong public industries, roughly three quarters of their
          economies is the public sector, and particularly industries that meet human needs have been nationalised. This
          protects the people from extortion by capitalists and massively helps to reduce economic inequality.
          Belarus and Azerbaijan are also sort of still socialist.
          These are countries of the former Soviet Union that have retained much more socialistic policies than the
          other former Soviet Countries, although most of them still have quite large public sectors compared with normal capitalist countries.
          The Soviet Union has left a legacy in the Eastern European and central asian countries and some of the benefits persist.
          They still have high rates of home ownership, large public sectors, free universal healthcare. Of course, the
          quality of this socialism has declined substantially.

        <p>
          This is what is known as "State Capitalism". The term can be somewhat misleading. To Marxists, the term "exploitation"
          is not pejorative, it doesn't necessarily have ngeative connotations. It literally just means taking some of the surplus
          value created by workers, you can then use that value for good or bad purposes. State capitalism is a government
          extracting surplus value from the population and using it to fund social projects, infracture and public services that
          are in the interest of society. The phrase, "state capitalism" was coined by the first leader of the Bolshevik party,
          Vladimir Lenin and used quite openly by both him and Stalin. Capitalist countries also practice "state capitalism",
          they just do much less of it and socialist governments do it much better. The socialist political system is designed
          in such a way as to select leaders who will be more willing and able to make wise public investments that are for
          the common good of society.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is also manufactured/artificial scarcity of jobs. Capitalists deliberately keep the rate of unemployment high. This
         makes workers more desperate
        for jobs and more willing to settle for lower wages. For this reason, Capitalist countries like the USA, Uk and Australia
        have seen steady economic growth, but no proportionate increase in people's wages. The workers create this growth,
        but have need seen their fair share of the benefit. Taking into account inflation, real wages have stagnated or decreased
        in the last few decades in the USA. In Australia, the gap between productivity and wage growth has grown substantially
        wider over the last two decades, workers have become gradually more and more exploited. The lower the wages, the
        greater the profits that the shareholders receive as dividends.

        <h2>Why cooperativism alone is not enough</h2>
        <p>Democracy within firms is only one of many aspects of socialism. Coops should be intergrated into a larger scale
          democratic economic plan for society that aims to meet human needs and wants. Democratic businesses can behave in
          as separate individual units within society and do not necessarily behave cooperatively and harmoniously with the businesses
          around them. Cooperatives can at times behave in capitalistic
          ways. The original worker-owners of a business may start hiring employees who are not shareholders and therefore second class
          workers who don't decide how profits are distributed. Democratic banks or credit unions can engage in usury, charging interest
          on loans. Some housing cooperatives may start taking on normal tenants who are also excluded fro group decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government of a country needs to impose rules to prevent cooperatives from exploiting other people or other cooperatives.
          In a socialist society, all cooperatives would be federated together. All firms in the same industry would be federated into
          a syndicate, choosing people to represent them at a syndicate assembly. All syndicates would choose people to advise the government.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be rules to ensure that there is a genuinely competitive and fair market, some sort of regulations to prevent businesses
          from having an unfair advantage simply because they have more money to spend on advertising. For this reason, in this cooperative
          marketplace all search results are randomised. We don't think this is necessarily the best solution, it is just something we are
          trying. We could also try setting limits on marketing budgets, setting the amounts proportionate to the demand for goods or services.
          There should also be rules restricting how much people can spend on political marketing,
          the government could provide all potential candidates with an equal sized budget for campaigning. Perhaps there could even a
          complete ban on this form  of advertising. Instead people should be encouraged to inform themselves about who the most capable candidates
          are. This will help to prevent rich people from being elected and imposing rules that concentrate power in their own hands.
          Within capitalist countries, this tendency is very strong.
        </p>


        <h2>Why are so few people familiar with the labour theory of value?</h2>
        <p>
          In a democratic society you would think such a fundamental and simple concept of economics would be taught to all children
          in all schools. However, a capitalist society is much less democratic than it seems to be. While the population can
          elect their own leaders, the range of choices are all from within a very small elite group of very wealthy people, almost
          all of whom profit in some way from capitalist exploitation, rents, dividends, interest or royalties. Many of them are
          landlords.

          Almost all politicians within capitalist countries are either very wealthy
          or they receive campaign funding from wealthy people. This is mostly because running political marketing campaigns on
          a large scale can be very expensive and the larger the constituency, the larger the budget. The largest mass media
          organizations within these countries are all organized like capitalist businesses in a severely undemocratic way.
          There is an unelected and unaccountable oligarchy of corporate shareholders and executives and orders flow downwards
          to the people who work for the organization. Even the public broadcasting services of capitalist countries are very
          undemocratic, for example the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is appointed by a bunch of capitalist
          politicians. These organizations are also heavily dependent on funding from capitalist businesses who pay for advertising
          on their medium. Even google search is a capitalist business. The elite allow journalists to criticise them within
          certain limits they decide. This creates the impression or illusion of democracy

          The Marxist Leninist political scientist Michael Parenti wrote in detail about this pro-capitalist bias in the media in
          his book Inventing Reality. Parenti has a PHD in political science from the University of Yale.
          “The basic distortions in the media are not innocent errors, for they are not random; rather they move in the same overall direction again and again, favoring management over labor, corporatism over anti-corporatism, the affluent over the poor, private enterprise over socialism, Whites over Blacks, males over females, officialdom over protesters, conventional politics over dissidence, anticommunism and arms-race militarism over disarmament, national chauvinism over internationalism, US dominance of the Third World over revolutionary or populist nationalist change. The press does many things and serves many functions but its major role, its irreducible responsibility, is to continually recreate a view of reality supportive of existing social and economic class power.”

          The system was designed this way. Modern capitalist "democracy"
          originated with the United States consitution, a system  largely inspired by the Ancient Roman Republic. This constitution
          was designed to be a "mixed", with a bit of monarchy (the president), a bit of aristocracy or oligarchy (the congress),
          and a bit of democracy (the population can vote every few years in elections). Modern societies are far too large and
          complicated in order to practice a very direct form of democracy, instead people must elect represenatives to make choices
          for the group. If everyone could be involved in making these decisions, this would be chaotic, you cannot have a coherent
          conversation with millions or billions of people. You want experts to be taking the time to reach informed choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea was for power and authority
          to be distributed in a meritocratic way, with the mass of the population delegating authority to reponsible, intelligent
          aristocrats who can lead the population in a direction that is in the best interests of the population. This concept
          has some validity, however it is implemented incorrectly within the capitalist system. Being willing and able to
          get rich by exploiting working class people does not tell us anything about the quality of someone's character except
          that they are perhaps more sociopathic than most people.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Democracy?</h2>
        <p>
          Historically, most of the political systems that have been labelled democracies were really oligarchies.
          Historians generally credit ancient Athens as the inventor of the concept of democracy. Their understanding
          was quite different from modern political systems. There were no representatives, just a huge assembly that
          anyone could attend, anyone could propose a group decision to be put to a vote. In order to ensure all citizens
          could participate, regardless how wealthy they were,
          the group would pay people to attend the assembly. They knew that some of the poorer Athenian citizens would
          not be able to afford to take time off work to vote unless they were paid. However, the Athenian economy was based
          on slavery, women and slaves were excluded from voting. Athens was really just a large Oligarchy with equality between
          members of the oligarchy.

          A group can nominal political democracy, but it does not necessarily lead to economic democracy. The is obviously
          the case in Athens, If anything, equality between the Athenians helped them to maintain dominance over their slaves.
          However, the exploited class of society does not necessarily need to be excluded from voting if the exploiting
          class cleverly disguises their exploitation. Nominal political democracy can even help to facilitate economic
          exploitation. People work with much more enthusiasm if they believe they are free and working for themselves.

          The political system of Switzerland is a clear example of this problem. The Swiss people have a very direct sort
          of democracy. Locally, they have directly democratic assemblies, sort of like the Ancient Athenian assembly.
          Their population is divided up into local assemblies each with several thousand members. Of course, the country
          has millions of people and one huge assembly would be chaotic. They also elect people to represent larger groups.
          People can initiate large scale referenda and overule their elected polticians with referenda.

          You might expect a country where people seem to have so much control to be classless and very humanistic. Strangely,
          Switzerland is probably the least socialistic country in Europe. They don't have a public healthcare system,
          housing is very expensive, most businesses are capitalist and the public sector relativey small.

          This is because their system is still prone to corruption. They still have direct election of representatives
          and therefore there is a tendency for representatives to be more wealthy as they have more money spend on marketing.
          The ability of citizens to initiate referenda can also be corrupted. California in the United States has a similar
          system where citizens can collect petitions to initiate referenda.
        </p>

        <h2>Democratic Centralism</h2>
        <p>
          The democratic centralist
          system practiced by marxist-leninist socialist countries largely helps to prevent this problem. The suggestion that
          these countries are dictatorships is just slander. There are archived CIA documents where they admit very blatantly
          that leaders of the Soviet Union, including Joseph Stalin, were not dictators and that the Communist Party was more like
          the "collective leadership" or the Union. Stalin was more like "the head of a team" that made decisions together.

          In the democratic centralist system, used by the USSR, China, Cuba and other countries, at all levels of
          representation, the constituency is much smaller, several hundred or sometimes thousand. People generally only vote for or nominate
          candidates they have met personally and can vouch for their good character. For these reasons, the National People's
          Congress of China only has about 24 capitalists out of 2980 delegates, less than 1%. There are billionaires and
          millionaires in the Chinese Communist Party, but they are a very small minority.

          Socialist Countries usually have
          recall procedures thta allow people to remove authority from their representatives at any time, rather than
          needing to wait until the next election. This gives a much stronger motivation for consultation and discussion between
          representatives and their people in order to find decisions most people are happy with. They can also have much more
          in depth and detailed discussions than in capitalist countries. If a politician represents hundreds of thousands or millions of people,
          their relationship with them will be much more shallow. The populations of Socialist Countries are much more politically engaged, with much proportions of party memberships.
          The Chinese Communist party has 95.15 million members, roughly one for 15 Chinese people. In Australia, there is roughly
          one ruling party member for every 190 Australian people.

          Socialist governments are much tougher on corruption, leaders who abuse their power in China go to prison for many years
          or decades. If you are going to steal from millions of people, you should be harshly punished.
          In capitalist countries, the worst thing that can happen to corrupt officials is that they resign, but
          they will usually still get a huge pension. The other politicians will usually congratulate you for taking one for the team.
          They're all corrupt, but sometimes politicians need to take the bullet for the rest to create the impression that
          powerful people will be held accountable for their crimes.

          Capitalist historians write about an event they call "Stalins Purges", between 1936-38 Stalin supposed ruthlessly
          repessed all opposition to humself within the Communist Party in order to assert his own totalitarian,
          autocratic control. This is a complete distortion, in reality, he was cracking down on a secret attempt to assassinate
          and overthrow Stalin.
          Albert Einstein was always a strong supporter of socialism and Stalin.
          In a letter to a friend of his, Einstein defended Stalin's attempts to cleanse the Communist party of the conspirators.
          “There are increasing signs the Russian trials are not faked, but that there is a plot among those who look upon
          Stalin as a stupid reactionary who has betrayed the ideas of the revolution.”
          Letter to Max Born (no date, 1937 or 1938); The Born-Einstein Letters (translated by Irene Born) (Walker and Company, New York, 1971) ISBN 0-8027-0326-7.

          The Marxist Historian Grover Furr, wrote a detailed book in which he established that the trials were genuine with substantial
          evidence to support the idea of a conspiracy to overthrow Stalin.

          The Constitution of Cuba has been drafted through a very extensive process of public consultation and discussion, involving
          the majority of the population. The document was submitted for approval by referendum. This process has happened twice,
          once in 1976 and again in 2019 each time with very high levels of voter turnout and approval, above 90%. Voting is
          completely voluntary in Cuba, with no punishment for not voting, however most people do because they feel that their
          thoughts and opinions are important and that the government cares what they think. Most laws in socialist countries
          require very extensive public consultation before they can be approved.

          Socialism is a much more genuinely meritocratic system. Ideally, authority should be grounded in moral integrity, wisdom,
          intelligence and expertise and not coercive exploitative power. The democratic-centralist system does a much better job
          of living up to this ideal than Capitalist "democracy". If you look at statistical indicators of the general level of
          fairness, cost of living, wage growth, crime and health, we can see that the Socialist countries are far more
          humanistic than the capitalist ones. There is an abundance of data that confirms this, much of it independently researched, from the
          World Bank, World Health Organization and the United Nations Development Programme. There is a simply web app that highlights this data.
          In general, socialist countries have a much cheaper cost of living, particular housing is more affordable.
          The Soviet Union was built houses at a faster rate than any other country and did not treat them as a commodity.
          People would just get houses because everyone needs a house and it is in everyone's interest for everyone to have houses.

          There are much
          higher rates of home ownership and much fewer homeless people, close to zero.
          More CIA documents reveal that citizens of the Soviet Union were better fed on average than US citizens.
          Education, particularly university, is much
          more affordable. There is an archived CIA document that admits that 70% of university students in the Soviet Union studied
          Socialist countries have better standards of mental and physical health, much fewer suicides, infant mortalities, teenage
          pregnancies, heart disease deaths, lung infection deaths, diabetes deaths. They tend to be more feminist. The USSR was
          the first country to heavily subsidize childcare, allow mothers to get abortions for free at public expense, decriminalize
          prostitution, allow women to study at university for free. The rates of unemployment are generally much lower in socialist countries,
          at around 1-2% in the USSR, Cuba and Vietnam, and abou 3.6% in China. Usually in Capitalist countries the rate of unemployment
          is at least 5% usually more. Crime is under much better control in the socialist world, these countries have much lower
          violent crime rates, much fewer murders, assaults and rapes. The rates of criminal re-offending are usually lower. In China
          only about 7% of criminals will reoffend within 2 years, in Capitalist countries this figure is usually at least 30%.

          There are further leaked CIA documents where they admit blatantly that the Bolshevik government aimed to turn their Gulag
          prison camps into rehabilitation facilities.Archived CIA document talking about the Gulags. "It was decided some time in 1956
          to convert all corrective labor camps into corrective labor "colonies" where the principle emphasis would be on
          rehabilitating the prisoners and returning them speedily to civilian life rather than on exploiting labor for economic purposes."

          "In about 1952-53, Soviet administrators evidently became convinced that economic progress in a modern industrial state must depend on the provision of incentives rather than the use of coercion and that therefore the huge prison labor force was a serious drag on over-all productivity. Moreover, by 1953, after about 25 years of the use of forced labor on a massive scale, a large part of the task of developing the habitable frontier had been accomplished, and most of the catastrophic destruction resulting from World War had been repaired."
          Another CIA document reveals that prisoners in the Gulags were always guaranteed a decent supply of food except for some
          of the harder times during world war 2. After 1954 criminals only had to work an 8 hour day and were paid fairly well and in proportion
          to the amount of work they completed. Only about 5% of prisoners were incarcerated for political crimes, and is that even
          a bad thing necessarily? Some political views are objectively harmful and dangerous, such as Nazism and Facism.

            cancer, prevented transmission of HIV from parents to children. They are currently developing a treatment for Alzheimers
            disease. China is building apartment blocks in 28 hours, constructing 2km wide space stations vastly bigger than any other,
            quantum supercomputers that are 100 trillion times faster than normal supercomputers, the world's largest network of
            superfast trains (that travel upwards of 250km per hour) and permanent human moon bases.

            The early Soviet Union was somewhat authoritarian. All governments tend to become more authoritarian during a crisis, the
            circumstances require this. For the first 30 years or so, the Soviet Union experienced crisis, their socialist system
            was born out of a terrible world war followed by a civil war. Immediately after this they needed to prepare
            for war with the Facists of Europe. In 1931, Stalin predicted that the USSR had about a decade in order to catch  up to
            the Western European Capitalist countries in terms of industrialization and development, otherwize the Germans would
            destroy them. They had only ten years to achieve what those other countries had done in 50-100 years. There was no
            time for debate or discussion, they just needed to industrialise as fast as possible.

            The Stalinist, "authoritarian" approach to socialism co-existed with other, more libertarian or free forms of socialism.
            There was libertarian socialist revolution in Spain, however these were quickly destroyed by the facists within a few years.
            Stalinism proved to be viable aand it delivered some very substantial improvements to the lives of working class people
            living within the Soviet Union. Later, after WW2, The USSR would become much more free, with economic planning becoming
            much less coercive and much more based on incentives. However, if the USSR had been destroyed early on, this more libertarian
            system would never have come into existence. Stalin laid the foundation. He had the unfortunate job of being the first
            leader to attempt to build socialism, within very little external support from the surrounding countries, in fact, many of
            them actively tried to destroy socialism. Mistakes were to be expected, but these were the mistakes of pioneers and not
            ones of careless, irresponsible leaders. The learning curve was steep.

            The populations of socialist countries are highly supportive of their own governments, and for very good reason.
            One Study conducted by Harvard University found that 95% of Chinese people support their government.
            The 1991 Soviet Union Referendum demonstrated that 78% of people in the USSR wanted to preserve socialism.
            Another poll found that 75% of Russians think that the Soviet Union was
            the "greatest time ever" in the history of their country.

          All countries experience protests, nobody is suggesting that Socialist countries are Utopian and that their
          populations never disagree with the government. Any time there is a protest within a socialist country the
          Capitalist media will tend to highlight these events, however, this doesn't tell us much of substance. Of course there are
          protests. Protest can also be a symptom of healthy democracy, it could be a sign that the people are more self
          confident, they have more freedom and are more willing and able to stand up to authority.
          People may disagree with the government about particular things, but still approve of their leaders overall. We need to know
          exactly how many protests there are relative to the size of the population, how large are these protests,
          how does this compare to other countries and how often does the government make concessions to protestors.
          The corporate media selectively display stories of people protesting in socialist systems in order
          to manipulate the working class people within their own countries, not to genuinely inform them about the dangers
          of socialism.

          In the case of Cuba, anti-government protests are very rare and only occur in times of crisis, like the Corona Virus
          Pandemic of 2020 or the recession that resulted from the collapse of the Soviet Union. In neither case is it fair
          to blame the Cuban Communist Party, but when people are desperate and suffering, they generally try to find a scape
          goat, someone to blame for their misfortune.

            Since the Russian Revolution in 1917, numerous socialist governments around the world have delivered very massive
            and substantial improvements to the lives of working class people, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty
            and giving them vastly more freedom. The Capitalists see these countries as an existential threat. Capitalists
            are a parasytic burden on society, but they also believe themselves to be morally and intellectually better than most
            people and that it is morally justified for them to steal from people. Of course, they do not want socialists to
            demonstrate that they themselves are frauds. For this reason, the Capitalist Ruling class have waged savage psychological,
            physical and economic warfare against socialism. They bombed and attacked the socialist countries of Yugoslavia, Lybia, North Korea,
            Vietnam and others, killing millions of innocent people. They've imposed cripling economic sanctions designed to
            impoverish countries. The United States government placed and economic blockade on Cuba that was designed explicitly
            "to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government."

                The Cuban Project, also known as Operation Mongoose, was an extensive campaign of terrorist attacks against civilians, and covert operations, carried out by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in Cuba. It was officially authorized on November 30, 1961 by American President John F. Kennedy.

In early November, six months after the Bay of Pigs, JFK authorized the CIA's "Program of Covert Action", now dubbed Operation Mongoose, and named Lansdale its chief of operations.

              How could any sane decent person think it is fair or even effective to punish the whole population of a country
              in such a savage and cruel way for the crimes of their supposedly "authoritarian" government. The truth is that
              Cuba and most Socialist Countries are not at all authoritarian, just the opposite. They are mostly authoritarian
              from the perspective of Capitalists.
              The US government needs to punish all of Cuba because it is one of the
              most democratic countries on Earth.
              There has also been a propoganda war against socialism, with the capitalist media slandering socialism and trying
              to encourage dissent within the socialist countries.

                The Elite have also set up their own fake left wing organizations in order to diffuse people's aggression into
                something useless. They present themselves as socialist and criticise capitalism, but don't provide any practical
                solutions. The slander genuine socialist countries and don't provide any constructive criticism. They encourage
                moral arrogance and puritanism. While all revolutions are substantially less than perfect and there
                are valid critcisms of all of them, many of them have
                acheived very substantial improvements to the lives of working class people. By encourage a perfectionist
                mindset, these pseudo-leftist organisations also promote feelings of impotence, nihlism and futility.

                One such organization was Congress for Cultural Freedom. Funded by the CIA  "The C.I.A.: Maker of Policy, or Tool?
                Agency Raises Questions Around World; Survey Discloses Strict Controls But Reputation of Agency Is Found to Make It
                a Burden on U.S. Action", The New York Times, April 25, 1966, p. 1.,

                this group established itself in 35, they published twenty anti-communist propoganda magazines.
                It held art exhibitions, owned a news and features service, organized high-profile international conferences,
                and rewarded musicians and artists with prizes and public performances
                different countries

                A number of other CIA funded and controlled anti-communist magazines included the Paris Review, the Partisan Review




                The rulling class has also established and funded false charities and NGOs that falsely accuse Socialist countries of committing
                human rights abuses. For example Amnesty international recieved many millions of dollars in bribes from ruthless
                imperialistic governments such as the USA, Israel, France and the UK. On their own website, they say they don't
                receive funding from governments in order to remain independent of political ideology. This is just a blatant lie
                and one that they arrogantly don't try to conceal very much at all. In the accounts that they publish on their own
                website, they admit quite blatantly that they have receive huge grants from capitalist governments.
                The NGO Human Rights Watch has recently accepted a hundred million dollar bribe from the billionaire George Soros.
